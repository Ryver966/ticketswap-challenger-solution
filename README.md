## Setup

First of all, you need to setup your local environment.
If you don't have [node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed yet, be sure to do so.

```shell script
> git clone git@github.com:TicketSwap/challenger.git
> cd challenger
> npm i
> npm run dev
```

## Solution description
If I will have more time to build this project as first I would like to focus on build types structure to have everything typed in many details as possible. The second thing is adding some integration Cypress tests for key functionalities like displaying list of events, implement some filtering, display details pages for event and location as well.
