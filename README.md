# TicketSwap challenger ðŸš€

Thank you for doing our challenger. The goal would be to finish the todo-list. If you have any questions you can always [contact us](mailto:rob@ticketswap.com).

## Approach

The challenger is setup in a way for you to showcase your creativity, eye for detail, UX skills and overall knowledge of HTML, CSS and TypeScript. Inside the challenge you'll find your goals set. There is a mocked database available inside the `/src/lib` folder. Feel free to make changes or add new data where needed. In general feel free to use other tools when needed if you have good reasons for this.

We've timeboxed this challenge for roughly _4_ hours. Some of these goals should be pretty straight forward. It's completely up to you how far you want to take it, but keep the timebox in mind. The challenge starts when you're installing the project.

## Assignment

### The Challenger has the following goals:

- Implement a search feature to find events.
- Add a filter to narrow events by location.
- Create an event detail page to display event information.

### Optional:

- Propose an additional feature - this can be a feature implementation, an API proposal, or any other improvement you see fit.
- Add automated tests where needed.
- Create a location detail page to display location-specific information.

## Setup

First of all, you need to setup your local environment.
If you don't have [node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed yet, be sure to do so.

```shell script
> git clone git@github.com:TicketSwap/challenger.git
> cd challenger
> npm i
> npm run dev
```

The server will start at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), where you can find everything you need to start with the challenger.

## Handing in the assessment

When you're finished you can send it to us in reply of the mail you got with this assessment or share the repo with [@RobVermeer](https://github.com/robvermeer).

### Good luck

And again if you have any questions, [let us know](mailto:rob@ticketswap.com)! ðŸ¤©
